# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction-for-Different-Buildings
The energy efficiency of buildings is an important aspect in regards to sustainable development, playing a role in reducing green house gas emissions and energy comsumption. In this project i am to predict the heating load of different building shapes with their varying characteristics such as glazing area distrubution, orientation etc.
